## forti_api
I started writing this because pre fortios 6.2 Threat Feeds can't be used in IPv4 Policys

The purpose is to block IP's based on Alerts within Graylog

Not super dynamic in terms of what it can handle from graylog at the moment. I'll probably fix that in the future.


## Example:
Linux server authlog -> Graylog Alert -> forti_api -> Fortigate
